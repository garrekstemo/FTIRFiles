# FTIRFiles.jl

FTIRFiles.jl contains the data read/write functionality for 
vibrational polariton experiments using a JASCO 4600 FT-IR 
(Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer) for steady-state measurements
and infrared spectrometer for femtosecond pump-probe dynamics experiments.

This code will be made available upon publication in the interest
of promoting open and reproducible science. ProjectIO is not written with 
the intention of it being used outside of the associated research projects.
